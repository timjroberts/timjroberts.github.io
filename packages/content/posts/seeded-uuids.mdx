  An example 'hand-cranked' function that generates the same UUID for a given seed value.

This is a quick post that demonstrates a function that will generate the _same_ UUID when presented with the _same_ seed value:

```typescript
const createUUIDfromSeed = (seed: string) => {
    const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256").update(seed).digest("hex");

    return [
      hash.substring(0, 8),
      hash.substring(8, 12),
      `4${hash.substring(12, 15)}`, // Set the version to 4
      `8${hash.substring(15, 18)}`, // Set the variant to 8 (RFC 4122)
      hash.substring(53), // Use the tail characters of the hash string
    ].join("-");
  }
```

With the version and variant values included in the correct segments, the UUID that is created should be compatible
wherever a standard UUID/GUID is required.

Alternatively, if you need a new UUID, rather than creating one from a given seed, generate the `hash` using something
like this:

```typescript
const hash = createHash("sha256").update(
  Math.random().toString(36)
).digest("hex");
```

This code runs in Node.js, and in modern Browsers, regardless of whether it is running in a secure context.
`crypto.randomUUID` _won't_ be available if you are not running in a secure context, and this will include `http` over
a custom domain. While it is rare for hosted domains to not be running over `https` these days, the code presented
here is still quite useful if you don't want to worry about secure contexts.

_Hello... hello. Is this thing on?_

There's nothing quite like starting a new blog. The fresh smell from the words on that first blog post is almost unforgettable...
only this isn't actually my first ever blog post. I've been running a blog for a fair number of years on my `'timjroberts.com'`
domain, and this will now be be the third time that I've _rebuilt_ it. The first blog I ran was focused
mostly on developer topics around the <Link href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft .NET stack</Link>. Alongside others,
I wrote a few posts around extensions for WCF and MEF that got some really nice numbers and backlinks that helped drive some early
day traffic. I paid for hosting yearly, but the provider made a mistake in thinking that I had not paid a bill, and took my hosting
down. Eventually when they realized their mistake, and they reinstated my account, they had no backup of my web site to reinstall.

Unfortunately, neither did I.

I incorrectly assumed that I was paying for backups as part of my hosting. I was wrong. I also didn't want the 
effort of maintaining backups myself, so I went for the easiest option and restarted the blog. _Backup, schmackup_! This time I went
for a managed Wordpress instance and set every option to `'auto'`. This included the automatic Wordpress updates, along with the
updates to the template that I had purchased. I had a few posts, but nothing significant, and then a few months ago I noticed a
permanent `"Service unavailable"` message displayed on my homepage. For weeks, despite much effort, I was even unable to login to
the Admin Console.

Finding out what had happened was taking far too much time and effort, and with the number of posts that I had written, I again simply
chose to restart the blog. And this..., this is where we are. Maintaining a blog isn't as easy and straight forward as you might think.
Especially for someone who wants to take the easy route. Even just

requires some effort</Link>, and sometimes, I wonder... is it worth it?

It is. Beyond the simple reasons of helping improve your writing skills, improving your confidence, and giving you a creative
outlet; blogging is a simple way to capture your thoughts, document something you've learnt, or journal your experience in a topic or
project that you're working through. Eventually, others will discover your blog, and they will read it. _Build it, and they will come_...
or something like that.

_What's to say that this won't happen again_? Well, nothing really. Shit happens all the time, but this time I'm managing it all
myself by using GitHub Pages. This brings with it some clear benefits, but the biggest being backups! With everything in a GitHub
repository, in theory at least, I shouldn't lose anything. That'll be a first for this blog! I'm building the _webiste_ using
<Link href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</Link> combined with React, and keeping the content (the pages and posts) seperate using
<Link href="https://contentlayer.dev/">ContentLayer</Link>. I should never lose my posts ever again, and I have the freedom to build
the webiste however I want - even change it in the future without having to worry about breaking content. _This is going to be great_!

The next time I restart this blog I won't create a post like this, but instead, just wonder whether anyone will have noticed. _YOU_ did
though - so thanks for reading.
